//Using what you've learned about functions and parameters, create a function that, given a name, will say "good day" to that person by name.

// For example, the function call greet("Anakin") would log to the console, Good day, Anakin!

// Level 2: Further customize your function by including the time of day in your greeting. Hint: can functions only take one parameter?

// Level 3: You and Count Dooku have beef. Further customize your code to to say, "I'm coming for you, Dooku!" if your function is called with "Count Dooku".



function greetPerson(person) {
    console.log ("Good day, "+ person+ "!")
}
greetPerson("Anakin")

function greetPerson(person,time) {
    if (person=="Count Dooku") {
console.log("I'm coming for you, Dooku!")
    }
    else {
      console.log("Good " + time + ", " + person + "!")
